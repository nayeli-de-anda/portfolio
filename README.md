## About me: 
Hi, I’m Nayeli De Anda, a Master’s student in Computational Social Science at UC Berkeley, where I use data to examine social inequities and inform policy. I hold a B.A. in Sociology with a Math minor from Sacramento State, where I developed a passion for making data more accessible, ethical, and impactful.

Previously, I worked at the Institute for Social Research, analyzing large datasets and presenting insights to government and nonprofit partners. I also taught SPSS and statistical modeling as an Instructional Student Assistant.

I’m passionate about bridging data science with real-world issues, particularly in health equity, misinformation, and privacy ethics. As a bilingual advocate for inclusive data practices, I strive to ensure data analysis amplifies diverse voices rather than excludes them.
